In this machine learning project, we build a classifier to detect the brain tumor (if any) from the MRI scan images.
By now it is evident that this is a binary classification problem. Examples of such binary classification problems are Spam or Not spam, Credit card fraud (Fraud or Not fraud).
Please download the dataset for brain tumor classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection
The images are split into two folders yes and no each containing images with and without brain tumors respectively. There are a total of 253 images.
Brain tumor detection project uses the below libraries and frameworks:
Python – 3.x
TensorFlow – 2.4.1
Keras – 2.4.0
Numpy – 1.19.2
Scikit-learn – 0.24.1
Matplotlib – 3.3.4
OpenCV – 4.5.2

Our approach to building the classifier is discussed in the steps:
1.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on brain tumor dataset
2.Build a CNN model
3.Train and Evaluate our model on the dataset
